# Nadav Alon - Portfolio

## About Me
I am a Computer Science graduate with a passion for computer graphics, AI, ML, and game development. My expertise spans across multiple programming languages and technologies, including Python, C, C++, C#, and Java.

## Projects

### 1. Machine Learning (Guided Project) – Keyframes Interpolation in Animation
**Technologies:** Python, Pytorch, Huggingface

- In animation, the most important frames in a shot are called keyframes. While in digital (3D) animation, the computer can interpolate the keyframes by itself, there is no solution for classical 2D animation - each frame must be hand-drawn by an animator.
- In this project, I am building a model based on the Diffusion architecture for generative images and videos. My model would provide a solution to the need to automate the hand-drawn animation pipeline.

### 2. Machine Learning – Classification of Wildfires in the US
**Technologies:** Python, NumPy

- As part of a competitive lab in a data science course, my team and I trained an XGBoost classification model that predicts the cause of a wildfire from a span of 12 possible causes.
- We preprocessed the data and analyzed it to find trends that will help us perform a better classification.

### 3. Escult – PC Puzzle Game
**Technologies:** C# (Unity's library)

- As part of a Game Jam course, my team and I developed a puzzle game. In the game, you play both roles of a girl and a cat made of blood. In each level, you need to use the cat’s 9 souls to solve the puzzle.
- The game was developed within 5 weeks during the first semester of my third year.

### 4. Computer Graphics (Project 4) – Shaders, Materials and Textures
**Technologies:** C# (Unity's library)

- Gained experience with texture mapping and sampling, lighting, and noise algorithms like Perlin Noise.
- Created shaders in Unity for Bricks, Earth, and Water textures.
- Wrote an interactive shader for the exercise’s bonus assignment. The shader showcases our solar system.

### 5. AI (Final Project) – Traffic Light Controller
**Technologies:** Python

- The project uses reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to improve traffic flow and reduce vehicle waiting times in a single-lane two-way junction simulator by coordinating traffic signal schedules.

### 6. Naughty-fier – Maintaining Focus App
**Technologies:** Python

- Participated in the HUJI hackathon (2022). My team and I developed an app to help ADHD students focus on their assignments. The app connects between the users' phones and PC. It detects when the user loses focus and notifies them via their phone until they refocus on their work or studies.
- I wrote the code that records how long the user hasn't touched their computer to know whether they're concentrating. I also created the simple UI of the PC application.

### 7. Unstable Journey to Haven – Web Arcade Game
**Technologies:** C# (Unity's library)

- Participated in a game jam hackathon, where my team developed an arcade game. The game was developed using the Unity engine and some scripting in C#.
- I was responsible for some of the game's key mechanics, such as attaching the hand to a rock.
